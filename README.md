# instrumentdefinitions
collection of MIDI instrument definitions, primarily for Cakewalk/Sekaiju and other MIDI sequencing softwares that accept such definitions!
The ones in /cakewalk-modified/ are NOT BY ME, rather they came with ancient Cakewalk. I modified some slightly to reflect my own hardware, use at your own risk

Ones I created are in the main folder and should work pretty much perfectly for those devices:
*Akai SG01V
*Alesis S4+ with card data (user bank may not reflect your own, you may want to update the names to whatever you have in yours!)
*GEM GM-X
*Casio LK93TV
*Yamaha DOM-30
*Yamaha DJX-iib
*Peavey DPM V3
